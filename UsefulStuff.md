Monte Carlo simulation methods do not always require truly random numbers to be useful


From papers:

Good Monte Carlo:

-the (pseudo-random) number generator has certain characteristics (e.g. a long "period" before the sequence repeats)
-the (pseudo-random) number generator produces values that pass tests for randomness
-there are enough samples to ensure accurate results
-the proper sampling technique is used
-the algorithm used is valid for what is being modeled
-it simulates the phenomenon in question.
